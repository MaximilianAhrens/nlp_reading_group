# NLP Reading Group @Oxford-Man-Institue

## Overview
This reading group focusses on **natural language processing for economics and finance**. Our aim will be to covering foundational papers such as different architectures of **transformers and attention structures** as well as on intersections of such NLP methods with e.g. 
 **1. language model numeracy**,
 **2. knowledge graphs and correlation matrices**,
 **3. cross-document/cross-dataset learning,
 **4. multi-modal learning,
 **4. **time-series applications**
